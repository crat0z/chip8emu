# chip8emu
another chip8 emulator written in C++. currently a mess, but it has a more or less functional debugger besides a memory/stack viewer.

# plans
- [ ] unspaghettify, in particular make everything more modular for future emulators
- [ ] stack viewer
- [ ] memory viewer
- [ ] unify stack/memory/register/disassembler windows, so e.g. open xxxx address in disassembler to view in memory viewer, view I in memory viewer, etc.
- [ ] call graph drawing, but this one might take a lot of work
- [ ] implement SCHIP etc quirks and settings to enable/disable
- [ ] actually fix the GUI in some spots

# how to build??
you're on your own for that, doesn't work on windows atm
